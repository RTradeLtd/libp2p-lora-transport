# libp2p-lora-transport

This is an experimental libp2p transport for communicating over LoRa, and possibly LoRaWAN. It is meant to be used with the Dragino LoRa GPS shields. And is capable of receiving data on LoRa and sending it through the serial interface, or reading from the serial interface and sending it thorugh LoRa. Essentially the arduino's act as a bridge between LoRa and LibP2P.
